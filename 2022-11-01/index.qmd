## Getting ready for Show and Tell

# Our mission is to *support*, *promote* and *connect* LGBTQ+ people in the R community and to *spread awareness* of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven activism. {background-color="#e6b3ff" .smaller70}


## LGBTQ+ people

-   those who identify as being a minority sexual orientation, i.e. those who are not straight/heterosexual

-   those who are not cisgender, i.e. those whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex

### These are rainbowRs!

. . .

[To our straight, cis friends: we very much appreciate your allyship and your support of rainbowR, e.g. by sharing our information and posts on social media and by telling your friends and colleagues about us.]{.smaller70}

## Since the last meet-up

- launched a new website: <https://rainbowr.netlify.app>

- written a new [Code of Conduct](https://rainbowr.netlify.app/coc)

- reopened the [Slack group](https://rainbowr.slack.com) with [sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/)

- launched the [TidyRainbow](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/tidyrainbow) project

- revitalised the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/R_LGBTQ) feed

- [gglgbtq](https://github.com/turtletopia/gglgbtq){target="_blank"} package

## Things that have gone well

- 47 new members in the Slack group (107 in total)

- lots of new Twitter followers

- lots of engagement with the TidyRainbow launch announcement tweet

## Where things could be going better

- very little activity on Slack, except for a few introductions in #welcome

- have only posted/publicised one TidyRainbow dataset

- would be good to have more people involved

## What next?

- regular zoom hangouts (monthly? quarterly?)

- send out another TidyRainbow dataset, and continue to do so regularly (monthly?)

- organise some kind of event on Slack to get people logging in and engaging in community there

- Make a rainbowR blog post template, then encourage others to contribute to blog

- ideas from the community
  
  - add to etherpad
